		        <p>I am a candidate for the masters in software engineering here at the Harvard Extension School. Prior to that I receieved a bachelors degree in Computer Systems Engineering from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. I am currently employed as a security guard.</p>

		        <p>I am taking this course to get a better understanding of dynamic web systems concepts as well as some hands on experience with web applications and content management. I'm hoping that this class can help me get a feel for how some of the programming familiarity I have can be tied together to actually build tools with web interfaces.</p>

		    <li>
		        <p>I have experience programming with C and Java. In addition to the required HTML/CSS, I have also had some exposure to Javascript, and PHP.</p>

		        <p>For this class, I expect to do all of my assignments on a PC.</p>
